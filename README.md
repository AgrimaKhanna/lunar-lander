This GitHub repository hosts the Lunar Lander project focused on solving the problem of landing a spacecraft with continuous action control. The Lunar Lander environment simulates the complexities of landing on the moon, where the spacecraft must manage its throttle and orientation continuously to achieve a safe landing.
